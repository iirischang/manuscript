Hi, I’m Iris.
This is the first project for the [Typography & Interaction class (2024-2025)](https://typography-interaction-2425.github.io/). 
The project is based on the article **“Words as Material“** by Nicole Fenton, published in March 2015.
I focused on exploring the relationship between typography and interaction with creating **HTML** and **CSS** to structure and style the webpage.
*Thank you for checking out my project!*
