        <h3>Nicole Fenton, March 12, 2015.</h3>
        <p>I gave this talk at RISD in Providence and UXLx in Lisbon. <br>Thanks to Tim Maly and Bruno Figueiredo for inviting me to speak, and to Allen Tan, Tina Lee, and Max Fenton for their thoughtful feedback on drafts.</p> 
        <p>I want to start with a quote from writer, activist, and teacher, Thich Nhat Hanh. In Being Peace, he writes:</p>
        <p><i>“If you are a poet, you will see clearly that there is a cloud floating in every sheet of paper. Without a cloud, there will be no rain; without rain, the trees cannot grow; and without trees, we cannot make paper. The cloud is essential for the paper to exist.”</i></p>
