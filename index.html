    <h1>WORDS AS MATERIALS</h1>
        <h3>Nicole Fenton, March 12, 2015.</h3>
            <p>I gave this talk at RISD in Providence and UXLx in Lisbon. <br>Thanks to Tim Maly and Bruno Figueiredo for inviting me to speak, and to Allen Tan, Tina Lee, and Max Fenton for their thoughtful feedback on drafts.</p> 
            <p>I want to start with a quote from writer, activist, and teacher, Thich Nhat Hanh. In Being Peace, he writes:</p>
            <p><i>“If you are a poet, you will see clearly that there is a cloud floating in every sheet of paper. 
            <br>Without a cloud, there will be no rain; without rain, the trees cannot grow; and without trees, we cannot make paper. The cloud is essential for the paper to exist.”</i></p>
            <p>Thich Nhat Hanh calls this concept interbeing. He goes on to say that the sun is also in the sheet of paper; and the lumberjack who cut down the tree; and his parents; and the wheat that made his morning bread; and so on. All of these things make it possible for the paper to exist. 
            <br>I bring up this story, because it helped me understand systems at a deeper level. I've been thinking a lot about what it takes to make a design project successful and even possible in the first place. I have a few hunches and I believe words play an important part in the process. But before I get to that, let's look at how the paper metaphor relates to us as designers.</p>
        <h2>How design works</h2>
            <p>Our work depends on many things: time, money, technology, materials, constraints, and most importantly, the lives, attention, and experiences of other people. We participate in and often orchestrate a process that's bigger than we are. Design requires collaborators, contributors, customers, toolmakers, factory workers, marketers, postal workers, call center agents, you name it. If we look closely, we can see that people are at the heart of everything we make.</p>
            <p>When I started writing this talk, I asked my designer friends on Twitter to answer this question: What's the number one thing that sabotages projects for you? Here are a few of their answers:</p>
        <h4>Ian Marquette (@ianmarquette)
            <br>a lack of clear understanding between myself and clients, which basically comes down to communication.</h4>
        <h4>Mark Forscher (@garbnzgh)
            <br>difference in expectations / poor communication</h4>
        <h4>Zak Greene (@zearl)
            <br>feedback from 18794387294 different people</h4>
        <h4>Matt Felten (@mattfelten)
            <br>Miscommunication. Handoffs to silos. Whatever the opposite of collaboration is.</h4>
        <h4>Jonathan Myers (@jnthnmyrs)
            <br>lack of extroverted thinking. One step at a time.</h4>
        <h4>Davin Risk (@davin):
            <br>Same as life really… lack of clarity around intent.</h4>
            <p>These problems boil down to one thing: communication. Sharing ideas with other people. Working through decisions together to make something new. We're here to make meaningful changes in the world, but we can't do that if we don't understand each other. We can't ignore people or work around them.
            <br>If we want design to communicate, we need to communicate in the design process.</p>
        <h2>How communication works</h2>
            <p>So I've been thinking about what communication looks like in the design process. 
            <br>Here's my take:</p>
        <h3>• Self
            <br>• Team
            <br>• Product
            <br>• Public</h3>
