				<p class="no-margin">I want to start with a quote from writer, activist, and teacher,</p>
				<p class="no-margin">Thich Nhat Hanh. In Being Peace, he writes:</p>
				<q>If you are a poet, you will see clearly that there is a cloud floating in every sheet of paper. 
				Without a cloud, there will be no rain; without rain, the trees cannot grow; and without trees, we cannot make paper. The cloud is essential for the paper to exist.
				</q> 
				<p class="paragraph">Thich Nhat Hanh calls this concept interbeing. He goes on to say that the sun is also in the sheet of paper; and the lumberjack who cut down the tree; and his parents; and the wheat that made his morning bread; and so on. All of these things make it possible for the paper to exist.</p>
				<p class="paragraph">I bring up this story, because it helped me understand systems at a deeper level. I've been thinking a lot about what it takes to make a design project successful and even possible in the first place. I have a few hunches and I believe words play an important part in the process. But before I get to that, let's look at how the paper metaphor relates to us as designers.</p>
		<p class="subtitle">HOW DESIGN WORKS </p>
				<p class="paragraph">Our work depends on many things: time, money, technology, materials, constraints, and most importantly, the lives, attention, and experiences of other people. 
				We participate in and often orchestrate a process that's bigger than we are. Design requires collaborators, contributors, customers, toolmakers, factory workers, marketers, postal workers, call center agents, you name it. If we look closely, we can see that people are at the heart of everything we make.</p><p>When I started writing this talk, I asked my designer friends on Twitter to answer this question:</p>
				<p class="question">What's the number one thing that sabotages projects for you? Here are a few of their answers:</p>
		<h4 class="designer">â€¢ Ian Marquette<a href="https://twitter.com/ianmarquette/status/575647978725093376" class="account"> (@ianmarquette)</a></h4>
			<p class="answer">a lack of clear understanding between myself and clients, which basically comes down to communication.</p>
		<h4 class="designer">â€¢ Mark Forscher<a href="https://twitter.com/garbnzgh/status/575669037352493057" class="account"> (@garbnzgh)</a></h4>
			<p class="answer">difference in expectations / poor communication</p>
		<h4 class="designer">â€¢ Zak Greene<a href="https://twitter.com/zearl/status/575670392725114881" class="account"> (@zearl)</a></h4>
			<p class="answer">from 18794387294 different people</p>
		<h4 class="designer">â€¢ Matt Felten<a href="https://twitter.com/mattfelten/status/575681220027142145" class="account"> (@mattfelten)</a> </h4>
			<p class="answer">Miscommunication. Handoffs to silos. Whatever the opposite of collaboration is.</p>
		<h4 class="designer">â€¢ Jonathan Myers<a href="https://twitter.com/jnthnmyrs/status/575663430067093504" class="account"> (@jnthnmyrs)</a></h4>
			<p class="answer">lack of extroverted thinking. One step at a time.</p>
		<h4 class="designer">â€¢ Davin Risk<a href="https://twitter.com/davin/status/575655021678759937" class="account"> (@davin)</a></h4>
				<p class="answer">Same as life reallyâ€¦ lack of clarity around intent.</p>
				<p class="paragraph">These problems boil down to one thing: communication. Sharing ideas with other people. Working through decisions together to make something new. We're here to make meaningful changes in the world, but we can't do that if we don't understand each other. We can't ignore people or work around them.
				If we want design to communicate, we need to communicate in the design process.</p>

		<p class="subtitle">READING RESPONSE</p>
			<p class="paragraph">When I saw the theme "Words as Materials", I couldn't help but wonder, how can we use words as materials? Is this using text for typography in design? Or use text to introduce the design? Or maybe some brand new ideas? The author mentions many experiences of working with writers as a designer, describing how designers and writers handle words as materials in different ways. As a magazine designer who has worked closely with writers, this article intrigued me.</p>
			<p class="paragraph">The author mentioned that when designers and writers face the same text material, their understanding will be different, so they need to spend time communicating and find a way of cooperating. She believed that ineffective communication would lead to design failure.</p>
			<p class="paragraph">This reminds me of my previous work experience. Our workflow typically involves the writer completing each article, the article will be provided to the designer for review. I then design and format the article based on its content and the photos provided by the writer. Sometimes, when I get the article, I realize that its length does not lend itself well to the design and layout, so I try to communicate with the writer to suggest adjustments to the article's length. However, this communication often fails because the writer believes that the current article length can fully express their stories and ideas.</p>
			<p class="paragraph">We have differing perspectives on words as material. Writers concentrate on how to tell stories through articles, while designers focus on enabling readers to effectively absorb and comprehend information through design within a limited layout. Through collaborative efforts and communication, we gradually found better ways to work together. Writers began to estimate the layout space for this issue based on the design of the previous issue and considered article length when selecting images. I chose to design after receiving the article, using the design to inform the writer about the necessary adjustments to the article's length.</p> 
			<p class="paragraph">As the author said, through effective communication between both parties, we reach a better balance. Once writers see the design, they are more likely to adjust the article length or choose to delete a few secondary images. I believe this is because people prefer having a reference rather than just imagining things.</p>
			<p class="paragraph">Looking back on these experiences, I not only felt the same when reading the article but also further learned how to utilize words as materials from the author's extended content. As mentioned in the article, the lack of clear vision can result in communication challenges and failure to achieve the desired results. Sometimes the client doesn't have a concrete idea of what they want, leaving designers with no idea where to begin and the team without direction. As designers, we can help customers discover their needs and find the core to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our collaboration.</p>
			<p class="paragraph">Thinking further about the concept of "words as material", I found that it was different from my initial guess. Word is no longer just a requirement for layout; it can also be given more meaning. They can help people understand and experience design, assist designers in effectively expressing their needs, and interact with users.</p>
