    <h1>WORDS AS MATERIALS</h1>
        <h3>Nicole Fenton, March 12, 2015.</h3>
            <p>I gave this talk at RISD in Providence and UXLx in Lisbon. <br>Thanks to Tim Maly and Bruno Figueiredo for inviting me to speak, and to Allen Tan, Tina Lee, and Max Fenton for their thoughtful feedback on drafts.</p> 
            <p>I want to start with a quote from writer, activist, and teacher, Thich Nhat Hanh. In Being Peace, he writes:</p>
            <p><i>“If you are a poet, you will see clearly that there is a cloud floating in every sheet of paper. 
            <br>Without a cloud, there will be no rain; without rain, the trees cannot grow; and without trees, we cannot make paper. The cloud is essential for the paper to exist.”</i></p>
            <p>Thich Nhat Hanh calls this concept interbeing. He goes on to say that the sun is also in the sheet of paper; and the lumberjack who cut down the tree; and his parents; and the wheat that made his morning bread; and so on. All of these things make it possible for the paper to exist. 
            <br>I bring up this story, because it helped me understand systems at a deeper level. I've been thinking a lot about what it takes to make a design project successful and even possible in the first place. I have a few hunches and I believe words play an important part in the process. But before I get to that, let's look at how the paper metaphor relates to us as designers.</p>
        <h2>How design works</h2>
            <p>Our work depends on many things: time, money, technology, materials, constraints, and most importantly, the lives, attention, and experiences of other people. We participate in and often orchestrate a process that's bigger than we are. Design requires collaborators, contributors, customers, toolmakers, factory workers, marketers, postal workers, call center agents, you name it. If we look closely, we can see that people are at the heart of everything we make.</p>
            <p>When I started writing this talk, I asked my designer friends on Twitter to answer this question: What's the number one thing that sabotages projects for you? Here are a few of their answers:</p>
        <h4>Ian Marquette (@ianmarquette):
        <br>a lack of clear understanding between myself and clients, which basically comes down to communication.</h4>
